Hey! I'm Shirin, a computer engineering student at [Amirkabir University of Technology(AUT)](https://aut.ac.ir/en).
My main research interests include **Cloud/fog Computing**, **Distributed Systems**, **IoT** and **Operating Systems**. Currently, I'm working on my bachelor projects that is "Implementing Emotion Detection System Based on Serverless Edge Computing in IoT applications" at Dr. Masoud Sabaei's lab under his supervision. I'm also research intern under the supervision of Dr. Adel N. Toosi at Monash University. Our research aim at proposing an interference aware scheduler for heterogeneous clusters.


Feel free to contact me if you need any further information.
